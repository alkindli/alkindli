Ah — you mean "Gigantic", the hero shooter MOBA-style game developed by Motiga and released around 2017. If you’re theorizing a “Turok x Gigantic” or imagining a Turok-style game in the world/style of Gigantic, here’s a bold hybrid concept:
Turok: Titans of the Hollow

A Gigantic-inspired action arena game set in the Turok universe
Core Concept:

    Think Gigantic’s bold art style, vertical maps, and fast-paced team gameplay — but fused with the Turok universe's savage wilderness, tribal-tech lore, and bioengineered dinosaurs.

Gameplay Format:

    5v5 Hunt Arena

    Objective: Slay enemy team’s Titan Behemoth while protecting your own.

    Players choose from Turok Heroes, each representing ancient clans with genetic or spiritual ties to dinosaur types.

Hero Classes:

1. Turok (Hunter/Tracker)

    Special: Silent bow that reveals trails; Dino decoy trap.

2. Nysa (Raptor-born Rogue)

    Fast claws, tail-whip dash, passive cloaking in jungle tiles.

3. Korga (Shield of the Ancients)

    Tanky club-wielder who can call a Triceratops charge.

4. Velox (Tech-Dino Sniper)

    Augmented human with AI-scope and venom rounds.

5. Umbra Maw (Behemoth Summoner)

    A rogue priestess who can summon skeletal dino-wraiths.

Titans (Gigantic-style):

    Instead of monsters like Aisling’s ghost or Griselma’s beasts, your team's Titan is a massive prehistoric god-beast:

        Volgrak – A volcanic T-Rex with magma breath

        Zharilith – A flying serpent that controls the sky

        Cthonox – A massive underground centipede-like dino, drills through terrain and erupts mid-map

Lore Angle:

    Set in a parallel Turok timeline where ancient dino-gods were awakened by reckless science.

    Clans now battle over control of Titan Cores, ancient crystals that link heroes to divine beasts.

Would you want me to draft character art descriptions, gameplay UI mockups, or a full trailer script for this fusion?
